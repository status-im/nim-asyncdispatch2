## Introduction

Chronos is an [asyncdispatch](https://nim-lang.org/docs/asyncdispatch.html)
fork with a unified callback type, FIFO processing order for Future callbacks and [many other changes](https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos/wiki/AsyncDispatch-comparison) that diverged from upstream's philosophy.

## Installation
You can use Nim's official package manager Nimble to install Chronos:

```
$ nimble install https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos.git
```

## Documentation

### Concepts

Chronos implements the async/await paradigm in a self-contained library, using
macros, with no specific helpers from the compiler.

Our event loop is called a "dispatcher" and a single instance per thread is
created, as soon as one is needed.

To trigger a dispatcher's processing step, we need to call `poll()` - either
directly or through a wrapper like `runForever()` or `waitFor()`. This step
handles any file descriptors, timers and callbacks that are ready to be
processed.

`Future` objects encapsulate the result of an async procedure, upon successful
completion, and a list of callbacks to be scheduled after completion or
cancellation. (These explicit callbacks are rarely used outside Chronos, being
replaced with the implicit ones generated by `await` chaining.)

Async procedures (those using the `{.async.}` pragma) return `Future` objects.

Inside an async procedure, you can `await` the future returned by another async
procedure. At this point, control will be handled to the event loop until that
future is completed.

## TODO
  * Pipe/Subprocess Transports.
  * Multithreading Stream/Datagram servers
  * Future[T] cancelation

When submitting pull requests, please add test cases for any new features or fixes and make sure `nimble test` is still able to execute the entire test suite successfully.
